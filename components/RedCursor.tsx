/*
 * RED CURSOR — PERFORMANCE EDITION
 *
 * The visual design remains a custom red pointer with:
 * - red dimensional pointer body
 * - bright contour
 * - inner highlight
 * - eye/core detail
 * - subtle cursor ring
 *
 * Performance architecture:
 * - zero pointer event listeners
 * - zero requestAnimationFrame loops
 * - zero React state
 * - zero moving DOM nodes
 * - zero per-frame style writes
 * - zero SVG filters
 * - zero animated shadows
 *
 * The browser/OS owns cursor movement directly.
 *
 * This is deliberately implemented as a native CSS cursor so pointer
 * movement is completely independent from the page's React/Canvas
 * rendering workload.
