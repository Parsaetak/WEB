/*
 * GLOBAL MUSIC PLAYER HOST (v4.0.2) — the ONE mount point of the
 * global Music player, rendered by the ROOT application layout
 * (app/layout.tsx) so the player survives every client-side route
 * change: Home, About, Blog, Work, Research, Contact, the topic
 * hubs, and the Media scene alike. It replaced the v4.0.x mount
 * inside LivingShell, which existed only on the "/" world shell and
 * lost the player UI on every route navigation.
 *
 * It still ships NO player code: it only
 *
 *   1. checks localStorage for a persisted session (a raw string
 *      probe — no store import, no catalog import) and mounts the
 *      lazy surface up front when one exists, so a full browser
 *      reload shows the RESTORED PAUSED player immediately; and
 *   2. listens for the store's one-time engagement signal
 *      (dispatched on the first explicit playback intent) and only
 *      then dynamically imports PlayerSurface.
 *
 * The mini bar, expanded player, queue UI, Media Session wiring, and
 * the single audio element live in the lazy chunk that cannot touch
 * any route's initial bundle or the static export's HTML. The
 * DOM-event bridge (a plain string event) is deliberate: it keeps
 * this host from importing the store module, so the entire player
 * subsystem stays out of the shared bundle until music actually
 * plays (or is restored).
