/*
 * BLOG SHARED LAYER — safe for client bundles.
 *
 * This module is the ONLY blog module that client components may
 * import. It contains types and pure formatting helpers and imports
 * no generated content data, so nothing from data/blog/posts.json can
 * leak into a client bundle through it.
 *
 * Boundary law (see worklog.md — Blog Data Access):
 * - lib/blog.ts      server-side data access (imports posts.json)
 * - lib/blogFormat.ts  types + formatters (zero data, client-safe)
 *
 * Client components receive article metadata as serialized props from
 * server components; they never import the content file themselves.
