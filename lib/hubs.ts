 * CONTENT ROUTE DATA — TOPIC HUBS + IDENTITY ROUTES (v3.1).
 *
 * Single source of truth for the static content documents:
 * /about/, /work/, and the six topic hubs. Every route here is a
 * real, independently useful page rendered from existing verified
 * site material — projects, articles, frameworks. Nothing is
 * fabricated: each article reference, project link and claim below
 * maps to content that already exists on the site or in the public
 * repositories.
 *
 * Laws:
 * - No thin pages: every hub defines the topic, states what Parsa
 *   Tak actually builds in that area, lists real projects, links
 *   genuinely related articles, and offers a next exploration path.
 * - Article relationships must be real. An article appears on a hub
 *   only when its subject matter genuinely belongs there.
 * - Anchor text is descriptive, never "read more".
 *
 * This module is server-side data: it imports no generated content
 * and is consumed by app/ pages and article-page helpers only.
