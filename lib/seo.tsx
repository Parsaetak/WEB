 * SITE IDENTITY + STRUCTURED DATA — SERVER SIDE.

 * One coherent entity model for the whole site. Every JSON-LD object
 * on every page resolves its author/publisher references back to the
 * @id values defined here, so the site never emits two conflicting
 * WebSite or Person objects.
 *
 * Laws (SEO Architecture):
 * - Production URL is the ONLY canonical base: absolute, HTTPS,
 *   stable, /WEB-aware. No localhost, no repository URLs, no
 *   alternate hosts ever appear in metadata or structured data.
 * - The origin and site name are DERIVED from data/routes.json (the
 *   canonical registry, via lib/routes.ts) — never re-declared here
 *   as independent literals (SEO v2 hardening, v2.1).
 * - sameAs contains ONLY real public profile URLs that the site
 *   already links through lib/links.ts. Nothing invented.
 * - Every structured-data object must describe something that
 *   actually exists on the page it is emitted into.
 *
 * This module imports no generated content and stays server-side:
 * it is consumed by app/ layouts and pages only.
