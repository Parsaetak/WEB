 *
 * INITIALIZING — application boot before the shell is interactive.
 * LOADING      — a required resource is being fetched for the current view.
 * PREPARING    — data is resident; the view is being composed or staged.
 * READY        — the view is usable.
 * ERROR        — a required resource failed and recovery is offered.

 *                     idle gap so it never competes with P1.
 * P3 BACKGROUND      — secondary metadata and future navigation targets.
 *                     Nothing currently schedules P3 work.
 * P4 USER-TRIGGERED  — PDFs, audio, video, heavy media. NEVER loaded

 * callback can begin speculative downloads before the first useful
 * paint — measured in v4.0.2 (predicted scene chunks and the RED
 * MAGIC organism chunk both started before FCP). `whenPageSettled()`
 * is the deliberate boundary every SPECULATIVE loader must respect:
 *
 *   critical page load → page usable → idle opportunity → speculation
 *
 * The promise resolves when the document has fully loaded (readyState
 * "complete" — every critical resource has finished) and one further
 * idle gap has been granted, so speculation can never steal bandwidth
 * or main-thread time from the first paint. A hard cap keeps a
 * stalled subresource from blocking speculation forever: after
 * SETTLE_CAP_MS the gate opens regardless (speculation is still
 * queued through the background scheduler's own idle pump, so the
 * low-priority guarantee holds either way).
 *
 * The promise is created once per page and shared by every caller
 * (scene preloader, RED MAGIC organism, any future speculative
 * loader). On the server and inside unit tests (no window) it
 * resolves immediately — the gate is a browser scheduling concern
 * only.
