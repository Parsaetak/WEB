/*
 * Resource store — typed async resource manager with an explicit
 * memory policy.
 *
 * Single source of truth for "load an async resource exactly once".
 *
 * Guarantees:
 * - request deduplication: concurrent callers share one in-flight promise
 * - failure cleanup: a rejected entry is removed so a later caller retries
 * - race protection: callers can pass an AbortSignal; aborted loads are
 *   dropped from the cache so the next caller starts fresh
 * - stale-result protection: entries older than `staleAfter` are re-fetched
 *   (in-flight entry is still shared while refreshing)
 * - bounded memory: the settled-value LRU never grows past
 *   RESOURCE_STORE_MAX_ENTRIES; the least recently USED settled entry is
 *   evicted first. In-flight entries are never evicted.
 * - TTL expiry: `short-lived` / `transient` entries are dropped when
 *   `staleAfter` elapses (checked lazily on access and in sweeps)
 * - explicit invalidation + safe retry after eviction
 *
 * RESOURCE LIFETIME CLASSES (see worklog.md — Cache Policy):
 *
 * - "immutable"    LONG-LIVED. Build-stamped data, content-addressed
 *                  assets, stable configuration. Kept until evicted by
 *                  the LRU bound (which in practice never fires for the
 *                  handful of immutable resources this site holds).
 *
 * - "short-lived"  REFRESHABLE. Remote/derived metadata that may change
 *                  (library media probes, manifests fetched at runtime).
 *                  Requires `staleAfter`; the settled value is dropped
 *                  after the TTL and re-verified on next use.
 *
 * - "transient"    DISPOSABLE. Prediction/preload scratch data and other
 *                  values that should not outlive a short window.
 *                  Requires `staleAfter`; aggressively swept.
 *
 * SESSION state (navigation) and PERSISTENT state (reading position,
 * preferences) still do not belong here — they live in React state and
 * localStorage respectively.
